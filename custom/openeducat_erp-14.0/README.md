MITIS²
======

From the Integrative Movement of Information Technologies (MITIS²) we have taken the initiative from the university spaces to make a fork of the OpenEducat odoo modules to adapt its functionality to the educational institutions of Venezuela.

Although version 15.0 of OpenEducat is available, we have decided to develop it in version 14.0 since we can take advantage of OCA modules that have not yet been migrated to version 15.0

From Venezuela and from our university movement, we thank all the developers who have contributed to this project that, under the LGPLv3 license, we can now benefit from to meet our goals of having Venezuelan educational software that can be used by many institutions in our country.
